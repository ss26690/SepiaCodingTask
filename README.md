# SepiaCodingTask

- Firstly, set up the project and install the required Pods.
- After, the initial setup of a project creates FileLoader class to Fetch’s file location.
- Then, the process is to get Json Data from the given location of the file and Parse this Data according to requirement.
- When Required data is available we can convert data as we can use or transform Json Data in created Model.
-  Finally, all required data is available and we can reload the table view to show the required data.


Used Pods:
- pod 'SwiftLint': To reduce unwanted from our code and create a modular or simplified code.
- pod 'Kingfisher’: To handle image cache for loading and maintaining the image in the table view.
